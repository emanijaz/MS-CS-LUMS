This is a very useful domain of Deep Learning known as Transfer Learning. We don't always have the luxury of time and computational power to adequately train a large model over our dataset. So, we use models which have been trained on large datasets (usually ImageNet) and then fine-tune them on our dataset. The intuition behind transfer learning for image classification is that if a model is trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world. You can then take advantage of these learned feature maps without having to start from scratch by training a large model on a large dataset.\r\n","\r\n","Here, we will fine-tune a previously trained model on imagenet to learn and classify three new class: Richshaw, qingqi and Tanga. \r\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o5dOkrpMXxwA"},"source":["### Dataset\r\n","\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3mbwUfb_YV07"},"source":["The dataset is divided into training set and testing set.
